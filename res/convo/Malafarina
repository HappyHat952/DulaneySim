Mr. Malafarina
O: Get on Mr. Malafarina's good side
...
+A-NO: It's the last day of the quarter. You check your grade and you have an 89% in Computer Science! Your parents will kill you if you don't get an A.
____B: Go up to Mr. Mal's desk.
+B-T2: He's working on a project right now. You hear lasers firing and see spaceships on the screen. He's very focused and doesn't notice you.
____BE1: Accept your grade and leave him alone.
____D: Interrupt him.
+D-T2: "What's the matter? I'm working on Astraeus right now."
____E: "Astraeus? I love that game! That unit was so fun and I enjoyed it so much."
____F: "Can you round my grade? I have an 89% right now."
+E-T0: "Really? Well since you enjoyed it so much, I'm thinking of making the Astraeus unit yearlong. What do you think?"
____G: "YEARLONG?! Please no..."
____H: "Hmmmm... that's a great idea! I'm sure everyone will love that!"
+G-T3: "How dare you disrespect my game... I'm taking 10 points off your grade right now!"
____BE2: "Whoops..."
+H-T1: "Thanks for the feedback! I need to get back to coding now."
____GE1: You go back to your desk, unsure if you did enough to save your grade.
+F-T3: "Why should I? You turned in your project a day late at 3 a.m."
____I: *Lie* "My flash drive corrupted and I had to recode the entire project."
____J: *Be honest* "Our group underestimated what we had to get done, and we all have AP exams we've been studying for."
+I-T3: "Nice try, but I can see you're using the same flash drive. Maybe next time don't make up an excuse."
____BE1: Well that was embarrassing.
+J-T0: "I see. I'll think about it. Thank you for being honest."
____GE1: You head back to your computer, not sure if your grade is safe or not.
+BE1-NO: Your grade stays at a B, and the 89% haunts you while you sleep. Your parents are disappointed.
