____B: Go up to Mr. Mal's desk.

____I: *Lie* "My flash drive corrupted and I had to recode the entire project."
____J: *Be honest* "Our group underestimated what we had to get done, and we all have AP exams we've been studying for."
+I-NO: "Nice try, but I can see you're using the same flash drive. Maybe next time don't make up an excuse."
____BE1: Well that was embarrassing.
+J-NO: "I see. I'll think about it. Thank you for being honest."
